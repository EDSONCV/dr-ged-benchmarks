#labels DR_Problems
= Data Reconciliation Benchmark Problems =
Data reconciliation are divided in 4 categories, which are the sub folders contained in /trunk/data_reconciliation folder:

    1 data_analysis 

    The aim of this problems is to test data filter (filter on the variables before DR is applied), data filter window selection and influence on the dynamics on the DR results. These problems were built using the xcos (simulink version of scilab, *compatible with scilab version 5.4*). The problem is a 2 tanks in parallel. Each tank has its own dynamic behaviour and a bypass valve to close the tanks feeding. The flowsheet is presented below:   

http://dr-ged-benchmarks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/data_reconciliation/data_analysis/diagrams/png/2tanks.png

When the dynamic system starts:
 * At time t0 where all flow is by-passed to streams 4 and 7.
 * At time t1, the bypass valve is closed and the inlet valve of tank 1 is opened.
 * At time t2, the valve to tank 1 is closed and inlet valve to tank 2 is opened. 
 * At time t3, the inlet valves of tank 1 and 2 are closed and by-pass valve is opened.

We have four implementations of this version:

1. The dynamic behaviour is *neglected* and *all streams are measured* (in folder ss_all_measured).

2. 1. The dynamic behaviour is *neglected* and *some streams are unmeasured* (in folder ss_unmeasured).

3. The dynamic behaviour is *neglected* and *all streams are measured* but a *gross error is added* at a given time, which can be setup by user (in folder gross_error).

4. The dynamic behaviour *must be considered* and *all streams are measured* (in folder dynamic).

5. The dynamic behaviour *must be considered* and *all streams are measured* and a *gross error* is added at a given time, which can be setup by user (in folder dynamic_gross_error).


    2 error_in_variables 

    Error in Variables (EVM) is a problem where a DR is carried out together with parameter estimation, the aim of this problem is to test algorithms for this problem class. 

    3 linear 

    Although linear problems are easy to solve in DR, since it have analytical solution, the aim of this problem is to test different objetctive function types, called robust functions. These robust functions can provide results with gross errors removed, however, to do this, some parameters must be tunned in these function. The aim of this class problems is to test these parameters set up. 

    4 non-linear 

    The aim of these problems is to test DR in more complex and non-linear problems. Some features are tested such as:

        How DR behaves with observable non-measured variables.
        How DR behaves with non-observable non-measured variables.
        How DR behaves with models which are approximated by model simplifications. 

 Each folder has 3 sobfolders: 

    * diagrams: a diagram of the process in the .dia and .png format.
    * scilab: the scilab implementation.
    * spreadsheet: a Excel spreadsheet of the data, results or some data handling necessary to run the model.
