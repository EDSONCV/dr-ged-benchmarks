== Introduction ==
The aim of Data Reconciliation is to _correct_ process measurements based on process models and measurement equipments errors.

DR is solved as an optimization problem, where the objective function is to minimize the difference between the measured/observed variables and the adjusted ones, weighted by reciprocal of the variance.
