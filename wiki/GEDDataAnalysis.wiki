== Gross Error Detection (GED) in time varying systems== 

    The aim of this problems is to test:
 * Different types of gross errors: constant bias, drifting bias, leakings and a combination of them.
 * Misscalibration: The effect of incorrect calibration in DR and GED.
 * Data filter: filter on the variables before DR is applied and its influence in GED.
 * Data filter window selection and influence on the dynamics on the DR results. 

GED in time varying systems are dividing in the following sub-folders:
 * diagrams
 * scilab

The "diagrams" folders contains the diagrams in "dia" format or in "png" formats while the "scilab" folders contains the problems itself. 

The "scilab" folder have 2 examples/folders: 

 * 2tanks: a 2 tanks with by-pass considering total mass balance.
 * reactor_separator: a reactor separator with recycle system considering total mass balance.

In each problem it was developed a steady-state problem and a dynamic version. These problems were built using the xcos (simulink version of scilab, *compatible with scilab version 5.4*).
