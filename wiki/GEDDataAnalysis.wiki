== Gross Error Detection (GED) in time varying systems== 

    The aim of this problems is to test:
 * Different types of gross errors: constant bias, drifting bias, leakings and a combination of them.
 * Misscalibration: The effect of incorrect calibration in DR and GED.
 * Data filter: filter on the variables before DR is applied and its influence in GED.
 * Data filter window selection and influence on the dynamics on the DR results. 

GED in time varying systems are dividing in the following sub-folders:
 * diagrams
 * scilab

The "diagrams" folders contains the diagrams in "dia" format or in "png" formats while the "scilab" folders contains the problems itself. 

The "scilab" folder have 2 examples/folders: 

 * 2tanks: a 2 tanks with by-pass considering total mass balance.
 * reactor_separator: a reactor separator with recycle system considering total mass balance.

In each problem it was developed a steady-state problem and a dynamic version. These problems were built using the xcos (simulink version of scilab, *compatible with scilab version 5.4*). 

Inside each folder, one find the following folders:

  * dynamic  : dynamic version of the diagram
  * steady_state : steady state version of the diagram.

In these implementations, the equipments are represented as a transfer function (a tank) and the difference between them is that in steady-state diagrams, the system dynamic is very fast.

There are also 2 files in the same folder level:
  * moving.sci: a moving average implementation.
  * dr_wls_simple.sci: a weighted least squares data reconciliation implementation.

The '2tanks/steady_state and 2tanks/dynamic' folder have the following folders:

  * ss_constant_bias: steady_state with constant bias.
  * ss_drifting_bias: steady_state with drifting bias.
  * ss_leakings: steady_state with equipment leakings.
  * ss_miscalibration: steady_state with sensor miscalibration.
  * ss_multiple_ge: steady_state with multiple gross errors (leakings and measurement bias)

The diagram of the 2 tanks problem is the following:

and the Xcos/Scilab diagram is the following:

http://dr-ged-benchmarks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/GED/data_analysis/diagrams/png/2tanks_scheme.png

where the first tank has a "slow" dynamic behaviour, the second tank a faster behaviour and the by-pass dynamic can be relatively neglected.

The sensor is represented as the following:

http://dr-ged-benchmarks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/GED/data_analysis/diagrams/png/sensor.png

where we have a random effect based on a normal distribution with zero mean and specific standard deviation; a gross error block and calibration functions that can be activated and configured by the user.

The gross error block is represented as

http://dr-ged-benchmarks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/GED/data_analysis/diagrams/png/gross_error.png

where it is possible to simulate a constant bias, sinusoidal, square or drifting bias or even a combination of them.

The leaking block is basically a subtraction and a check to avoid negative flows as 
http://dr-ged-benchmarks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/GED/data_analysis/diagrams/png/leaking.png

The dynamic system behaves as the following: 

    At time t0 where all flow is by-passed to streams 4 and 7.
    At time t1, the bypass valve is closed and the inlet valve of tank 1 is opened.
    At time t2, the valve to tank 1 is closed and inlet valve to tank 2 is opened.
    At time t3, the inlet valves of tank 1 and 2 are closed and by-pass valve is opened.


 === 2 Tanks Problem Parameters ===

In the "ss_constant_bias" folder, individual gross errors in measurement (bias) are set to +5 units (constant along all the simulation).

In the "ss_drifting_bias" folder, the individual gross errors in measurement (bias) starts at time = 200 s (to stream 1 to 7) and at 300s to stream 8. The rate of increase is 0.01 units/s along the simulation.

In the "ss_leaking" folder, the individual leakings starts at time = 0 s have a magnitude of 4 units along the simulation.

In the "ss_multiple_ge" folder, the multiple gross errors are added at the start of the simulation according to the following table:

|| Scenario || Leaking (magnitude) || Bias (magnitude) ||
|| 1        || - || S1 (-3); S6 (5) ||  
|| 2        || Mixer (4) || S2(5)   || 
|| 3        ||Tank 1 (4) || S8 (5)  ||
|| 4        || By-pass(3) || S5(-3); S3(5) ||

  * ss_miscalibration: steady_state with sensor miscalibration.

In the "ss_miscalibration" folder, we have a second order polynomial to represent the output behaviour of the sensor according to the table :

||           || S1 || S2   || S3    || S4   || S5  || S6    || S7    || S8    ||
|| constant  || 0.5|| -0.5 ||3      ||-0.5  || 0   || -1    || -2    || 3.5   ||
|| linear    ||1.3 || 0.8  || -0.2  ||0.1   || 0.8 || 1.2   ||  0    || -1.3  ||
|| quadratic ||-0.06||0.05 || 0.05  ||0.15  || 0.06|| -0.03 ||  0.1  || 0.11  ||


The 2 tanks steady-state diagram is the same as the dynamic, but with a very "fast" dynamic behaviour in the tanks and by-pass.
