-scilab (the scilab implementations)
-spreadsheets (excel or openoffice spreasheets)
-diagrams (png or .dia diagrams)
Inside 'diagrams' folders there are 'dia' folder and 'png' folder. 
Some diagrams are only on the 'png' folders while others are on both 'png' and 'dia' folders.
'spreadsheets' and 'diagram' folder contains 'self explained' files related to each problem.
Inside each problem 'scilab' folder there are a specific 'Readme.txt' file to describe the files.
